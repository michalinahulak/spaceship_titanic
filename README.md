The project was created during the Advanced Data Science course. It contains a classification problem.
The quest and dataset comes from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data).

### Introduction
The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.
While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!

### Goal
The aim of the project is to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.

### How to Run the Project?
To open the project, use the git clone command or download the selected files.
